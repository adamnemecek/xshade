# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to xshade! Before contributing please get in touch via [github issues](https://github.com/Vengarioth/xshade/issues), someone else might work on a similar thing. There are many ways to contribute to contribute to this project:

* [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)
* [Language Feature Requests](#language-feature-request)
* [Compiler Feature Requests](#compiler-feature-request)
* [Writing Documentation](#writing-documentation)
* [Writing Tutorials](#writing-tutorials)
* [Other Contributions](#other-contributions)

## Bug Reports
While bugs are unfortunate, they're a reality in software. We can't fix what we don't know about, so please report liberally. If you're not sure if something is a bug or not, feel free to file a bug anyway.

If you have the chance, before reporting a bug, please [search existing issues](https://github.com/Vengarioth/xshade/search?q=&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93), as it's possible that someone else has already reported your error. This doesn't always work, and sometimes it's hard to know what to search for, so consider this extra credit. We won't mind if you accidentally file a duplicate report.

Opening an issue is as easy as [following this link](https://github.com/Vengarioth/xshade/issues/new) and filling out the fields.

All three components are important: what you did, what you expected, what happened instead.

## Language Feature Requests
To suggest new features and ideas for the xshade language, open a new issue [following this link](https://github.com/Vengarioth/xshade/issues/new).

## Compiler Feature Requests
To suggest new features and apis for the compiler, open a new issue [following this link](https://github.com/Vengarioth/xshade/issues/new).

## Writing Documentation
Contributions to our documentation are also welcome. Just create a pull request with your changes to the contents in the `docs` folder.

## Writing Tutorials
We do not recommend writing tutorials at this point. Both the language and the compiler will be in flux until version 1.

## Other Contributions
We are also happy about any other contribution to the project.
